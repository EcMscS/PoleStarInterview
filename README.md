## Thank you

Thank you very much for taking the time to review my project for the role of iOS Developer. I appreciate there are aspects of the design that could be improved, but I am happy with the result that I've submitted to you based on the brief provided.

I am hugely passionate about app development, and would love to be given the opportunity to progress to the next stage of the interview and to become a member of your team. If however I am unsuccessful, I would really appreciate your time for some constructive feedback as if there is anything I can do to improve for the next time it would be very beneficial to me. 

Any questions or problems please feel free to contact me on: chrishefferman@me.com or 07540 577057.

Thanks again,
Chris Hefferman
