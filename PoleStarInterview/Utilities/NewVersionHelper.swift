    Thank you for taking the time to view my PoleStar take-home project 🙌🏼
    
    I found the project very enjoyable, and I hope that you find it up to your expectations.
    
    I've not used the Twitter API before, and it was great to learn a little about how that worked.
    
    I decided to add a few additional features that the brief didn't ask for, this includes support for dark mode, pagination of a users' Tweets as well as a like counter - something that seemed to come relatively easily from the API.
    
    As for who to search for, the brief asked for my favourite influencer. There have been so many that have supported my ongoing journey into iOS development, however I would recommend Sean Allen (@seanallen_dev). You can check out my Twitter feed if you search for @heffertron! 
    
    I am keen to hear what feedback you have on the code and so I'm more than happy to have someone talk to me about what I could have done better and what things I've implemented well.
    
    I look forward to hearing from you 🤓
    
    Thanks
    Chris 😄
